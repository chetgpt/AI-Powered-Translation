1. Identify the Context
Recognize that the text is from a religious context, which can provide clues about the content and vocabulary used.
2. Look for Direct Cognates
Spot words that are directly recognizable across both languages. Religious texts often have cognates due to shared history and translations.
3. Analyze Syntactic Patterns
Observe sentence structure which can be similar across languages that have influenced each other or have a shared heritage.
4. Use Known Translations
Utilize any provided translations (like the Indonesian text given) to inform the meaning of the Simalungun text.
5. Compare with Familiar Languages
Compare unfamiliar words with similar sounding or structured words in languages I am trained on, such as Indonesian or other Austronesian languages.
6. Cross-reference with Scripture
If available, compare the text with known religious scripture translations. In this case, the verse is likely from the Bible, which has standardized translations in many languages.
7. Infer Meaning from Contextual Usage
Use the context in which words appear to infer meaning. Words that appear in a list of commands or blessings in religious texts often have similar functions across languages.
8. Check for Repeated Phrases or Patterns
Repeated structures or phrases can provide hints about meaning, especially in poetic or formulaic texts like religious scripture.
9. Apply Logic and Elimination
Use logical deduction to infer the meaning of unknown words based on the known elements of the sentence.
10. Acknowledge Uncertainty
Be aware of the limitations of this method and that without direct knowledge of the language, some interpretations may be speculative.
11. Seek Confirmation
